Cloning to the Local Machine
==

## Steps
1. Go to the desired repository on your machine.
2. On the repository page, there is a button that has the label `< >`. Click that button. A dropdown should pop showing options for cloning.
3. Focusing on the "Local" option, there are three choices: we can clone to local via HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub Command-line interface (CLI). 
4. Open a terminal in the directory for the local copy's destination.

!!! note

    If you are cloning `your-repository-name` 
    into the `destination` directory,
    the resulting file structure will be
    `destination/your-repository-name`
