Fork a Repository
==

## Overview
Just as you’d fork a piece of food to pick it up, you can fork someone else’s repository to create your own copy.
It allows you to modify the code without affecting the original repository, giving you freedom to experiment it as much as you can.

This page helps you how to fork a repository.

## Conclusion
In this page, you have learned how to fork someone else's repository. Forking gives you the freedom to experiment and modify the code without affecting the original project, enabling you to work independently or contribute back via pull requests. With your fork successfully created, you can now make changes locally, push commits to your fork, and collaborate further.
