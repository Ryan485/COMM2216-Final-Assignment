Creating Repository
==

## Overview
Repository is a centralized storage location, often a folder or directory, where developers store and manage a project's source code, allowing for collaboration, version control, and tracking of changes.

This page covers how to create a repository and how to change a private repository to public.

1. Go to Github following the link below:
   ```
   https://github.com

   ```

2. Once you are on Github, go to the top right corner and **Click** on the '+' sign:

    ![+ sign](img/Github_Create_Repository.png){: style="height:100%;width:150%;align:center"}

3. **Click** on New repository

    ![+ new repository](img/new_repository.png){: style="height:200px;width:200px;align:center"}

4. Set your repository name under **Repository name**
    ![+ name repository](img/repository_name.png){: style="height:50%;width:80%;align:center"}

5. Set your repository to **Private**.
    ![+ public or private](img/public_private.png){: style="height:80%;width:100%;align:center"}

!!! note

    Unless you want to share your code with others, it is generally recommended to set your repository **Private**. You can always change it to **Public** when needed.
